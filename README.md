# Forest Cover Type Classification using LightGBM



## Objective

To develop a high-performance multi-class classification model to predict forest cover types using LightGBM.



## Dataset

Covertype Data Set (UCI Machine Learning Repository)



## Project Workflow

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Class imbalance analysis

- Feature engineering (5+ new features)

- Stratified train-test split

- Baseline LightGBM model

- Hyperparameter tuning using RandomizedSearchCV with Stratified K-Fold

- Final evaluation (Macro \& Micro F1, Precision, Recall)

- Confusion matrix visualization

- Feature importance analysis (Split \& Gain)

- Comparative analysis with Random Forest



## Key Results

- Tuned LightGBM outperformed baseline model.

- Improved Macro F1-score after hyperparameter tuning.

- LightGBM demonstrated efficient training performance.
